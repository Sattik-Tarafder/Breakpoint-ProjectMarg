# ProjectMarg — AI Pothole Detection System

**ProjectMarg** is an AI-powered road condition analysis system that detects potholes from images and videos and generates a road severity score to support faster and safer infrastructure decisions.

---

## Problem

Manual road inspections are slow, expensive, and reactive — leading to delayed repairs, vehicle damage, and accidents.

---

## Solution

ProjectMarg uses **computer vision** to automatically:
- Detect potholes from images & short videos  
- Visually mark damaged areas  
- Generate a road **severity score**  

This turns raw road footage into **actionable data**.

---

## Tech Stack

- **AI**: Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, NumPy  
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  

---

## How It Works

1. User uploads an image or video  
2. AI model detects potholes  
3. Severity score is calculated  
4. Annotated output is shown on the frontend

## Note

The AI backend is not deployed due to high compute requirements and free-tier limitations.  
Frontend and AI components are currently decoupled.
